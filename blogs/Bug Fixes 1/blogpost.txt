In my last post, I talked about the `Undo` feature that was implemented. Undo allows you to revert the last valid move that you made and will put back the score that you had then, with a hit of two points. I demonstrated all the different ways that you can undo your move, basically all the different possible moves that constitute a valid `Undo` move.

Furthermore, I introduced a bunch of bug fixes related to the game. I did not demonstrate how the bug fixes are now working, however future blog posts that include bug fixes will not be accompanied by a small demonstration of the expected result.

I had scheduled some time for me to work on the `Autocomplete` feature. For this feature, the user will be able to right click anywhere on the board, and all the cards that are face up that can be moved to any of the foundations will be moved there. I don't see this feature taking a lot of time to implement since being able to move a card to the foundation has already been implemented, such as when the user double-clicks on a card.

As I was preparing myself to start work on this feature, I glanced over at the number of bugs that I logged, and I felt that it would be a nice gesture to get a few of the bugs out the door before I introduce a new feature that would undoubtedly introduce a few bugs here and there.

Therefore, I took a step back and got to work on a bunch of bugs, which I will present to you below.

1. Clicking on the stock and then performing an undo, does not subtract 2

https://github.com/danielricci/solitaire/issues/126
2. Double-clicking on an Ace will position itself momentarily at 0,0 if you hold the mouse down on the second mouse down

3. Switching from outline to non-outline does not update the cards in the talon view

https://github.com/danielricci/solitaire/issues/98
4. When dragging multiple cards in outline mode, the outline does not look consistent

https://github.com/danielricci/solitaire/issues/128
5. In outline mode, doubling to automove a card shows a small green artifact on the status bar

6. Talon Card Proportions

7. Automove shows the card at the top left on the second mouse down

https://github.com/danielricci/solitaire/issues/133
8. Dragging more than one card causes the cards to be cut at the bottom when playing in a timed game

https://github.com/danielricci/solitaire/issues/134
9. Playing a timed game causes the card to jump to the origin every tick

Now that I closed a lot of bugs, It's time to implement another feature. I will continue my work on the Autocomplete item.

You can always follow my progress by following the game located at https://github.com/danielricci/solitaire and if you have any questions I will do my best to answer them. 

Take care, until my next blog post.
