# Solitaire

### Description
This game is a remake of the Microsoft Windows 95 implementation of Solitaire. This game is meant to preserve the state of the original game. Apart from minor bug fixes to the original game, this game aims to demonstrate and preserve the originality of the vanilla classic.

### Software Stack
The game was last implemented using the Java SE 8 [1.8.0_181 SDK]. The game will most probably work on other flavours of the Java standard, however in the event that it doesn't please let me know.

Bugs and other issues/questions/concers/praises should be written to me at thedanny09@icloud.com
