# Solitaire

This game serves as a loving homage to the classic Solitaire experience originally found in Microsoft Windows 95. It faithfully preserves the essence and charm of the original game, with only minor bug fixes applied to ensure a seamless experience. My goal is to showcase and honor the timeless appeal of vanilla Solitaire for Windows 95, allowing players to relive those nostalgic moments with authenticity.
