# Solitaire

### Description
This game is a remake of the Microsoft Windows 95 implementation of Solitaire. This game is meant to preserve the state of the original game. Apart from minor bug fixes to the original game, this game aims to demonstrate and preserve the originality of vanilla Solitaire for Windows 95.

Apart from the animation of the card deck which I will complete when I am done my asteroids game, this implementation is a 1-1 replica as best as I can possibly recreate it. All the settings have been replicated, from outline dragging to vegas and cumulative scoring, to the end game card shuffle loadout animation. This is as close to the metal as I can make it.

This game has taken me a little over a year to do, and I loved almost every minute of it, except for some annoyances inherit to Java Swing, however I made sure to put Swing in it's place.

I really, really hope you enjoy this game, because I am very proud of this re-creation.
